## Development 
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/opensource254/mock-api.git`
2. Navigate into the directory `cd mock-api/`
3. Install npm(recommended) dependencies `npm i` or with yarn `yarn`
3. Start the dev server with auto reload `npm run dev` or with yarn `yarn dev`
4. Your server is now running at `localhost:3006` the default port be free to change to your desired port.

## Production
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/opensource254/mock-api.git`
2. Navigate into the directory `cd mock-api/`
3. Install npm(recommended) dependencies `npm i` or with yarn `yarn`
4. npm start. 
Your app is now running on `localhost:3006` which is only accessible via LAN to enable WAN access(Not recommended), Edit
`bin/www` change the address from locahost to `0.0.0.0`.
Your API can now be accessed via `your-ip:3006`.

A better way is to use a reverse proxy with a web server of your choice. I'd recommend nginx.
